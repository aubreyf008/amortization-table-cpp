# ðŸ’¸ Amortization Table Generator in C++

A command-line tool written in C++ that calculates and prints an amortization table based on user input: loan amount, interest rate, and monthly payment. Built as an introductory programming project at Auburn University.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- User input validation (no negative or zero values)
- Converts annual interest rate into monthly rate
- Dynamically calculates interest and principal payments
- Stops when the loan is fully paid or payment is too small
- Prints formatted amortization table to the terminal


## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- Fundamentals of C++ (loops, I/O, formatting)
- How interest and amortization schedules work
- Output alignment and formatting using `iomanip`
- Writing readable and testable procedural code

## ðŸ›  How to Compile

If you're on Linux/macOS with g++:

```bash
g++ -o amortization project1_Foote_caf0074.cpp
./amortization
